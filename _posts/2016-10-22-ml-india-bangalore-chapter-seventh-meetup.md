We are pleased to inform that the seventh ML-India meetup in its Bangalore chapter was held on 22nd October 2016.


The meetup revolved around the application of machine learning algorithms to map a person's skills to relevant jobs. They had a guest speaker, [Shashank Srikant](https://shashank-srikant.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, a senior research engineer at [Aspiring Minds' research lab](http://research.aspiringminds.com/){:target="_blank"}. His key work there has been in developing and leading automated programming evaluation products. He has developed algorithms for performance assessment, maintainability and semantic assessment of software code. He has filed multiple patents around this work and has published results at leading conferences like KDD and NIPS. He likes to engage in computer science/mathematics education and pedagogy formulation.


He talked about why the problem of mapping a person's skills to the right job is one of great relevance today. He explained how one can cast this as a problem in machine learning and how more such real-world problems can be framed in a machine learning paradigm. He discussed some of the challenges that one may face while doing so. He also shared insights one can draw from all the data that's collected about people's skills once such a technology is successfully deployed. He also talked about the technology behind the software products developed by Aspiring Minds and how it is used to quantify skills to efficiently map people to the right jobs.


The talk drew from the following work:

- A system to grade computer programming skills using machine learning.", S. Srikant and V. Aggarwal, KDD 2014


- Automatic Spontaneous Speech Grading: A Novel Feature Derivation Technique using the Crowd.", V. Shashidhar, N. Pandey, V. Aggarwal, ACL 2015


- Learning Models for Personalized Educational Feedback and Job Selection", V. Shashidhar, S. Srikant, V. Aggarwal, Machine Learning for Education, Workshop at ICML 2015.

Weâ€™ll keep up with having such engaging meetups on ML, and having researchers and practitioners involved in ML to discuss their work and insights. Looking forward to future meetups. Spread the word to your friends from Bangalore to enroll for the meetups.
