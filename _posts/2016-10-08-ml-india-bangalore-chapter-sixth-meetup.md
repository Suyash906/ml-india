We are pleased to inform that the sixth ML-India meetup in its Bangalore chapter was held on 8th October 2016.

They had a guest speaker, [Susan Eraly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/susan-eraly-8a2b2839){:target="_blank"}, a Software Engineer at [Skymind.io](https://skymind.io/){:target="_blank"}, contributing to Deeplearning4j. She talked about Skymind, and Deeplearning4j and why they exist.

She gave a brief introduction to Deeplearning4j stack and some highlights about it. She explained how Deeplearning4j can be used to auto-generate Shakespearean styled content and how a recurrent NN can learn arithmetic operations.

They talked about how one can tune neural networks and discussed some tricks and tips to execute it efficiently. She encouraged everyone to get involved with [Deeplearning4j](https://deeplearning4j.org/), an open-sourced library for deep learning.

The response and feedback from the participants were very encouraging! The discussion was very vibrant and the participants had a lot of questions. Weâ€™ll keep up with having such engaging meetups on ML, and having researchers and practitioners involved in ML to discuss their work and insights. Looking forward to future meetups. Spread the word to your friends from Bangalore to enroll for the meetups.
